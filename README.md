# ticket-handling-slack-bot
This is a Slack bot written in Python. It was written in the summer of 2018.

The slack bot was used by my company for a short time to handle ticket submissions to the DevOps team. It forced users to select items from drop downs and fill out certain fields, making the tickets more descriptive and therefore reduced the time it took the DevOps team to fulfill them. The bot is comprised of drop downs, input fields, and other typical form fields. The progression of the bot is based on the user's input from each step.
